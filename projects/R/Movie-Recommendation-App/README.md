# Movie Recommendation App (R Shiny)

This project is an interactive movie recommendation tool built in R using the Shiny framework. The app allows users to select movies they enjoy and receive personalized recommendations generated from association rules.

The goal of this project was to create a simple, intuitive interface that demonstrates how data-driven recommendations can be made using real-world methods like market basket analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project highlights my experience with:

- R programming and reactive Shiny components  
- Association rule mining (`arules` package)  
- Building clean, user-friendly interfaces  
- Structuring a recommendation workflow  
- Deploying interactive analytics tools  

It reflects how I approach technical problems: break them down, simplify the experience, and build a clear system around the logic.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user selects movies they enjoy.  
2. The app filters association rules to find strong co-occurrences.  
3. Recommendations are sorted by confidence or lift.  
4. Results are displayed as a clean, simple output table.  

The app uses reactive expressions to update results instantly based on user selections.
