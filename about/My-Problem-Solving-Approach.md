# My Problem-Solving Approach

This is the general approach I follow when I’m troubleshooting an issue, improving a workflow, or trying to make a process run more smoothly. I naturally look for ways to create structure, remove friction, and make things more efficient. Whether it’s a technical problem or an operations challenge, I use the same mindset: understand what’s happening, break it down, and rebuild it into something clearer and easier to use.

---

## 1. Start by Understanding the Problem Clearly

I try to understand what the person was trying to do and where things started to fall apart. I ask simple questions:

- What was the goal?  
- What were you expecting to happen?  
- What actually happened?  
- When did it start?  
- Has anything changed recently?  

This gives me a clean starting point and prevents solving the wrong problem.

## 2. Reproduce the Issue

If I can reproduce the issue myself, I can usually understand it faster.  
I try the exact steps the user took, and then I test a slightly different version to see if the behavior is consistent.

For operational problems, this means walking through the process the same way someone else would. I look for steps that feel unclear, repetitive, or inefficent.

---

## 3. Break the Problem Into Smaller Parts

Big issues usually come from one or two small breakdowns.

I separate the problem into pieces:

- Is it a data issue?  
- A workflow issue?  
- A communication gap?  
- A missing step?  
- A permissions problem?  
- A misunderstanding of how something works?  

Once everything is broken down, the path forward becomes much clearer.

## 4. Look for Patterns

Patterns tell you a lot about what’s actually going wrong.

I look for:

- Does it happen every time or only sometimes?  
- Does it affect all users or specific users?  
- Did it start after a certain update or change?  
- Does the process break down in the same place each time?  

Patterns help me confirm whether the issue is technical, operational, or user-related.

---

## 5. Check the Most Likely Failure Points First

Instead of jumping straight into complicated explanations, I check the basics:

- Are timestamps updating?  
- Are fields correct?  
- Is the information complete?  
- Are people following the same steps?  
- Does the workflow make sense for how it’s actually being used?  

This helps avoid wasting time on overly complex theories when the issue is often something simple.

## 6. Validate with Data, Logs, or Real Examples

I like to confirm my assumptions with something objective:

- Logs  
- API responses  
- Submitted forms  
- Workflow steps  
- Patterns in user behavior  
- Documentation or history  

This helps me make sure the root cause is real before attempting to fix anything.

## 7. Rebuild the Process to Make It Clearer or More Efficient

Once I understand the root cause, I look at whether the system or process could be improved in a broader way.  
This is usually where my operations and efficiency instincts kick in.

I ask:

- Can this step be simplified?  
- Can the process be standardized?  
- Can we make the information easier to find?  
- Is the same question being asked repeatedly?  
- Does this need a template, form, or workflow?  

I enjoy creating systems that reduce friction and make things run smoother for everyone.

## 8. Communicate Clearly and Calmly

As I work through the problem, I make sure to communicate what I’m seeing in a way that feels straightforward and easy to follow.

I explain:

- What I checked  
- What I ruled out  
- What I think is happening  
- What I plan to try next  

Clear communication keeps everyone aligned and reduces confusion.

---

## 9. Confirm the Fix and Make Sure It Sticks

After applying a fix, I test again and ask the user to confirm that everything looks correct.  
I also check for:

- Side effects  
- Related issues  
- Patterns that might show up again later  

For operational workflows, I like to test with a few different examples or edge cases.

---

## 10. Document What I Learned

Once everything is resolved, I document:

- What caused the issue  
- How it was fixed  
- What steps should be added, removed, or changed  
- What the new or improved workflow looks like  

Good documentation prevents the same issue from coming back.

## Final Thoughts

My problem-solving approach is structured but flexible. I like creating clarity where things feel messy and building systems that make work easier for the people using them. Whether the issue is technical, operational, or somewhere in between, I focus on understanding the problem, breaking it down, and creating a solution that improves efficiency long-term.
