# My Systems Design Approach

I naturally think in systems. Anytime a process feels unclear, messy, or inconsistent, I start looking for ways to turn it into something more structured and reliable. This approach guides how I design workflows for operations, community management, and technical processes.

Here’s how I typically approach system design:

## 1. Understand the Current State
I start by observing how things are actually happening—not how they were intended to happen. Real usage reveals gaps, bottlenecks, and places where people are improvising because the system doesn’t support them well.

## 2. Identify Friction Points
I look for anything that slows people down:
- unclear responsibilities  
- missing steps  
- duplicated work  
- inconsistent messaging  
- scattered information  

These friction points usually surface the real problem.

## 3. Simplify and Standardize
A good system should make decisions easier, not harder.  
Where possible, I:
- reduce steps  
- consolidate information  
- create templates  
- standardize workflows  
- automate repetitive tasks  

The goal is a cleaner, more predictable process.

## 4. Build Something People Will Actually Use
A system only works if it feels intuitive. I design workflows that fit how people naturally work rather than forcing them into something overly complex. Clear instructions, examples, and templates help ensure adoption.

## 5. Iterate Based on Real Use
No system is perfect on the first try. I revisit workflows after a few weeks, gather feedback, and adjust based on what people actually needed.

This approach has shaped everything from KMC’s onboarding and scheduling systems to documentation workflows and technical troubleshooting processes. I enjoy creating order out of chaos and designing systems that help people work more efficiently.
