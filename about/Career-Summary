# Career Summary / Who I Am

I’m someone who naturally gravitates toward clarity, structure, and efficiency. Whether I’m solving a technical issue, organizing information, or building a workflow from the ground up, I like creating systems that make work easier and more predictable for the people using them.

I’m currently completing my Business Analytics degree at the University of Tennessee, where I’ve gained experience working with data, technical tooling, and structured problem-solving. Alongside my academics, I spent three years at Apple in a highly technical support role. There, I developed strong troubleshooting skills, learned how to diagnose complex issues under pressure, and became comfortable translating technical information into clear guidance for users and internal teams.

Outside of school and work, I founded Knoxville Movement Collective, a 350+ member outdoor community that runs weekly events across Knoxville. Building KMC required me to design operational systems from scratch—onboarding workflows, scheduling processes, communication templates, safety reporting structures, and documentation that helped volunteers stay aligned. It gave me hands-on experience improving processes, anticipating edge cases, and creating systems that scale as a team grows.

Across all of these experiences, the theme is the same: I like taking something messy and making it make sense. I enjoy breaking down problems, understanding how pieces fit together, and creating workflows or documentation that help people move forward confidently.

I’m drawn to technical analyst and documentation-focused roles because they align naturally with how I think. I like solving problems, organizing information, supporting users, and building systems that make teams more efficient. This portfolio reflects my approach to that work, through both real examples and scenario-based case studies.
