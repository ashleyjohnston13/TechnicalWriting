## Overview  
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password. This guide walks you through setting up MFA on a typical online account.

## What You'll Need  
- Access to your account (email, username, password)  
- A smartphone with an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy)

## Steps to Set Up MFA

1. **Log into Your Account**  
   Go to the website or service you want to secure and log in.

2. **Navigate to Security Settings**  
   In your account settings, locate the "Security" or "Privacy" section. Look for a Multi-Factor Authentication or Two-Step Verification option.

3. **Choose MFA Method**  
   Select the method you'd like to use. Common options include:
   - Authenticator app (recommended)
   - SMS code
   - Email verification

4. **Scan QR Code or Enter Setup Key**  
   Open your authenticator app. Scan the QR code shown on the website or enter the manual setup key.

5. **Confirm and Activate**  
   Enter the 6-digit code from your app into the website to confirm setup. Once verified, MFA is active.

6. **Save Backup Codes**  
   Many services offer backup or recovery codes. Store them in a secure location in case you lose device access.
