# Technical Portfolio Overview

This portfolio brings together my work across **technical writing, systems documentation, troubleshooting, and workflow design**. I enjoy creating structure where things feel unclear and building processes that make information easier to understand and use.

Inside this repository, you'll find:

- **Example technical case studies** developed to demonstrate structured problem solving, root cause analysis, and clear documentation  
- **Real operational workflows from KMC**, a community organization I founded and designed systems for  
- **Guides and instructional documentation** written for clarity, usability, and simplicity  
- **About documents** that capture my approach, philosophy, and background

# Why I Built This Portfolio

I’m drawn to roles where I can:

- organize complexity  
- create clarity in documentation  
- solve problems through structure and analysis  
- build workflows and systems that reduce friction for teams  
- support users with patience and clear communication  

Technical writing and systems analysis combine the strengths I’ve developed across Apple, UTK, and Knoxville Movement Collective.

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate that — through real examples, example scenarios, guides, and my overall approach to designing clear, dependable systems.

Thanks again for taking the time to explore my work. I hope you enjoy your day.
