# Ashley Johnston – Technical Writing & Systems Analysis Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights my work across technical writing, process design, and systems documentation. I enjoy creating structure where things feel unclear and designing workflows that make it easier for people to get things done. Whether it's troubleshooting a technical issue, organizing information, or building an operational process, I focus on clarity, efficiency, and simplicity.

## About This Portfolio

This repository includes a mix of real and example-based work:

- **Example-based technical case studies**  
  Fictional scenarios created to demonstrate my troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and documentation style. These do not reflect any real company or proprietary system.

- **Real KMC operational workflows**  
  These case studies are based on actual systems I designed as the founder of Knoxville Movement Collective, a 350+ member outdoor community. They show how I build processes, reduce friction, and create consistency for teams.

- **Technical guides**  
  Step-by-step instructions written with clarity, structure, and user experience in mind.

- **About documents**  
  These explain my background, problem-solving approach, documentation philosophy, and the systems mindset I bring to technical work.

## Why I Built This Portfolio

I’m drawn to roles where I can organize complexity, create clarity, and build systems that help teams work more effectively. Technical analysis and documentation combine my strengths in:

- clear communication  
- structured problem solving  
- operational efficiency  
- user support  
- systems thinking  

This portfolio reflects how I approach that work.

Thanks for taking the time to look through my projects — I hope you have a great day!
