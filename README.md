# Ashley Johnston – Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Ashley Johnston, a Business Analytics student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with a passion for creating clear, user-focused technical content. My background in technical support, customer education, and data analysis has shaped the way I approach writing: always with clarity, purpose, and the end user in mind.

## About Me

I specialize in turning complex ideas into clear, accessible documentation. Whether it's a step-by-step guide, user manual, or knowledge base article, my goal is always the same — to make tools, software, and data easier to understand and use.

While completing my Business Analytics degree, I’ve developed strong skills in communication, critical thinking, and simplifying complex information. I also bring nearly four years of experience as a certified Apple Genius, where I’ve explained technical processes to thousands of users and trained peers on best practices. These experiences continue to inform my approach to writing.
