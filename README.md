# Ashley Johnston - Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio! I'm currently a **Business Analytics student** at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and I am passionate about **creating clear, user-centered documentation**. Although I am still developing my career as a technical writer, my experience in **data analysis** and **problem-solving** has given me the foundation to communicate complex ideas in simple terms.

## About Me
I’m driven by the challenge of turning complex data and technical concepts into accessible, understandable content. Whether it’s a step-by-step guide, user documentation, or API reference, my goal is to create writing that helps users make the most of their tools and software.

As I pursue my Business Analytics degree, I’m learning how to think critically about data, identify insights, and communicate those findings effectively. These skills are directly transferable to technical writing, where clarity, accuracy, and audience understanding are key.
