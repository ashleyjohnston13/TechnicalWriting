## Overview

As KMC grew and more coaches and captains started leading events, our weekly event scheduling process became difficult to manage. Every leader sent their event details in different formats, at different times, and through different channels. Pulling everything together each week took a lot of manual work and often led to missed details or last-minute updates.

I redesigned the process to create a simple, organized workflow that made it easy for leaders to submit their events and easy for me to publish a clean weekly schedule.

## Problem

Before the new workflow, several issues came up:

- Leaders submitted event details through scattered messages (texts, DMs, GroupMe, email).  
- There was no consistent format or checklist for what information to include.  
- Some events were missing important details like distance, pace, location, or required gear.  
- Deadlines were unclear, so details often arrived too late to promote properly.  
- I had to chase people down for missing info every week.  
- It became harder to maintain a professional, consistent event calendar.  

As the number of weekly events grew, the old process wasn’t sustainable.

---

## Impact

The lack of structure created a few challenges:

- Weekly schedules took too long to assemble and review.  
- Important details sometimes slipped through the cracks.  
- Promotion timelines were inconsistent.  
- Members didn’t always get clear, reliable event information.  
- Leaders felt unsure about what they needed to send and when.  

We needed a workflow that kept everything organized and easy to manage.

## What the Process Looked Like Before

Leaders would often send information like:

- “Hey I’m running something Thursday, I’ll send details later”  
- Two or three screenshots with route maps  
- Half-complete notes shared quickly before bed  
- A location without a specific meet-up point  
- Or event details arriving after the schedule had already been posted

Nothing lived in one place, and nothing followed a consistent pattern.

## Investigation and Discovery

To redesign the workflow, I looked at:

- The most common missing pieces of information  
- Where the delays happened each week  
- What leaders struggled with when planning events  
- What members asked about the most  
- Which details needed to be standardized for safety and clarity  
- How much time I was spending each week assembling everything  

The main takeaway was that we needed a single place for submissions and a simple structure for leaders to follow.

## Solution: A Centralized Weekly Event Submission Workflow

I built a clearer, more streamlined system with a few main components.

### 1. A standardized event submission form  
Leaders fill out the event title, date, time, route or hike details, pace, distance, gear requirements, and any disclaimers. Every submission follows the same format.

### 2. A weekly submission deadline  
Leaders know exactly when their event details are due. This helps with planning, graphics creation, and scheduling posts.

### 3. A shared calendar for internal use  
This gave me and the leadership team a way to see planned events at a glance and avoid scheduling conflicts.

### 4. Templates for the public-facing weekly schedule  
By standardizing event descriptions, each week’s posting became faster and cleaner.

### 5. A consistent workflow for last-minute changes  
If something changed (weather, location, pace), leaders had a defined way to request updates so we didn’t miss anything.

## Implementation

Once the workflow was ready, I shared it with all coaches and captains. We walked through the form, the timeline, and how the new system worked.

Leaders then began:

- Submitting events using the structured form  
- Following the weekly deadline  
- Reviewing their events before publishing  
- Using the same formatting across all events  
- Sending changes through the correct channel  

After a few weeks, things became noticeably smoother.

## Results

The improved workflow made weekly scheduling significantly easier:

- Event submissions became consistent and complete.  
- Publishing the weekly schedule took far less time.  
- Leaders stopped sending scattered messages with partial details.  
- Members received clearer, more reliable event information.  
- Fewer mistakes and last-minute issues came up.  
- The overall process felt more organized and professional.  

The workflow also scaled well as more leaders joined the team.

## Documentation Created

To support the new process, I created:

- Weekly event submission form  
- Submission deadline guidelines  
- Internal event calendar structure  
- Templates for event descriptions  
- Instructions for handling last-minute changes  
- A quick reference guide for new leaders

## Lessons Learned

Small gaps in communication can turn into much bigger problems as a community grows. By giving leaders a simple workflow to follow, we improved consistency, reduced confusion, and made it easier to maintain a strong weekly event schedule. This workflow continues to support KMC’s growth and helps us run events more efficiently.
