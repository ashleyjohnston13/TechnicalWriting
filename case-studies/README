# Case Studies

This folder contains a collection of case studies designed to demonstrate how I approach troubleshooting, workflow design, systems thinking, and documentation. These examples highlight the type of analysis, structure, and clarity I bring to technical and operational problems.

## About These Case Studies

Most of the technical case studies in this folder are **example scenarios** created to showcase my problem-solving approach.  
They are *not* based on real companies, proprietary systems, or confidential work.

All KMC-related case studies **are based on real workflows and processes** I designed or managed as the founder of Knoxville Movement Collective.

## Purpose

The goal of these case studies is to illustrate:

- how I break down complex issues  
- how I identify root causes  
- how I design efficient, scalable systems  
- how I document findings in a clear, structured way  
- how I communicate technical information to different audiences  

These examples offer insight into how I think, how I approach problems, and how I create systems that make work easier for teams.
