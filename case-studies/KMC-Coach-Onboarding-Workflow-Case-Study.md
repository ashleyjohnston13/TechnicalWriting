# KMC Coach and Leader Onboarding Workflow Redesign

**Role:** Founder / operations lead  
**Context:** Knoxville Movement Collective – volunteer-led fitness and outdoor community  
**Date:** 2024

## Overview

As KMC started growing quickly, onboarding new coaches and captains became harder to manage. Every leader came in with different expectations, different levels of preparation, and different understandings of what their roles involved. There wasn’t a clear process that guided someone from “I want to lead” to “I’m ready to run an event confidently.”

I redesigned the onboarding workflow to create something consistent, clear, and repeatable. The goal was to make sure every leader knew what was expected of them and had the tools they needed to succeed.

## Problem

Before the new workflow, onboarding had several issues:

- Every coach or captain was starting from a different point.  
- Expectations and responsibilities weren’t written down anywhere.  
- Waivers and safety requirements were sometimes missed.  
- New leaders often had to ask the same questions over and over.  
- There was no simple place to track who was onboarded and who wasn’t.  
- Event quality and structure varied from leader to leader.  

The lack of structure started to slow down KMC’s growth and created confusion for both leaders and members.

---

## Impact

These gaps caused real challenges:

- Leaders didn’t always feel confident running their first event.  
- Important responsibilities were sometimes unclear or overlooked.  
- Communication between teams wasn’t consistent.  
- I was spending a lot of time explaining the same information repeatedly.  
- It became difficult to scale the program as more people volunteered.  

It was clear that we needed a streamlined onboarding system before adding more leaders.

## What the Process Looked Like Before

The “old process” was basically a mix of informal messages, verbal explanations, and random documents that weren’t organized in one place. A new coach might get:

- A message in GroupMe  
- A link sent separately  
- A quick explanation on a phone call  
- A few screenshots or examples  
- And then a hope that things would go smoothly  

Nothing was standardized, and that made the experience different for every person.

## Investigation and Discovery

Before building a new system, I spent time understanding where the real breakdowns were.

I looked at:

- Questions new leaders asked most often  
- Where leaders were getting stuck or confused  
- What responsibilities were unclear  
- How long onboarding typically took  
- Which safety or waiver requirements were sometimes skipped  
- What information leaders needed but weren’t getting consistently  

It became obvious that the process needed to be centralized, documented, and structured in a way that didn’t rely on repeating the same information manually.

## Solution: A Standardized Onboarding Workflow

I designed a new onboarding workflow that covered everything leaders needed to get started, all in one place.

The updated process included:

### 1. A central onboarding document  
A single guide that outlined expectations, responsibilities, safety requirements, communication norms, and step-by-step instructions for running events.

### 2. A formal onboarding form  
Leaders filled out a form that collected the information needed for scheduling, communication, waivers, and internal coordination.

### 3. A consistent approval and handoff process  
Once the form was submitted, I verified everything (waiver status, experience level, availability) and then added the leader to the appropriate communication channels.

### 4. Event planning templates  
I created simple templates for weekly events so leaders had a clear structure to follow and didn’t have to start from scratch.

### 5. Clear expectations  
This included expected communication timelines, event quality standards, safety reminders, and guidelines for interacting with members.

### 6. Organized storage of all documents  
Everything moved into a shared KMC drive with the same layout for every coach/captain.

## Implementation

After the workflow was finalized, I onboarded several new leaders using the updated system. Each person:

- Completed the onboarding form  
- Received the full onboarding document  
- Reviewed expectations and safety requirements  
- Was added to communication channels  
- Was given event templates and examples  
- Scheduled their first event with support  
- Had a clear place to go if they had questions  

This removed most of the back-and-forth that used to happen.

---

## Results

The new workflow made an immediate difference:

- New leaders felt more confident and prepared.  
- Onboarding time decreased significantly.  
- I spent less time repeating the same information across multiple conversations.  
- Event quality became more consistent.  
- Safety and waiver compliance improved.  
- Communication across leadership became more organized.  

The entire process became scalable, which mattered as KMC continued to grow.

## Documentation Created

As part of the redesign, I created:

- KMC Coach & Captain Onboarding Guide  
- Onboarding Form  
- Event planning templates  
- Safety & waiver reminders  
- Role-specific responsibility checklists  
- A simple tracking sheet to monitor onboarding progress

## Lessons Learned

Building this system showed me how much clarity and consistency matter when you’re working with a growing volunteer team. Even small gaps or assumptions can turn into bigger problems over time. Having everything documented and centralized not only helps new leaders, but it also frees up time and reduces errors.

This redesigned process has become a foundation for how KMC brings new leaders into the community.
