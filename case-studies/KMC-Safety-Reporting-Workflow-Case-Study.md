# KMC Safety Reporting and Escalation Workflow

**Role:** Founder / operations lead  
**Context:** Knoxville Movement Collective – volunteer-led fitness and outdoor community  
**Date:** 2024

## Overview

As KMC grew, we started receiving occasional questions or concerns about member interactions or situations that made someone uncomfortable. These situations were rare, but when they did happen, I realized we didn’t have a clear way for members or leaders to report something, and we didn’t have a consistent process for deciding what to do next.

I created a safety reporting and escalation workflow so anyone could share a concern privately, and so leaders had a structured way to review the situation and take the right next steps.

## Problem

Before the new system, a few issues were clear:

- Members didn’t know who to contact if something felt off.  
- Reports came through random channels (texts, DMs, comments, side conversations).  
- Important information wasn’t always captured in the same format.  
- Leaders weren’t always sure how to respond or escalate.  
- Sensitive issues didn’t always have a documented trail.  

This created confusion and inconsistency, which isn’t ideal for member safety or accountability.

---

## Impact

Without a structure in place, we risked:

- Missing key details because reports weren’t documented  
- Responding differently to similar situations  
- Delayed action when something needed quick follow-up  
- Leaders feeling unsure about their authority or responsibility  
- Members losing trust if concerns weren’t handled well  

It became clear we needed a clean, private, and repeatable process that supported both the person reporting and the leadership team.

## What Reporting Looked Like Before

Before this workflow, safety concerns came in through:

- Instagram DMs  
- Text messages  
- Verbal conversations at events  
- GroupMe messages  
- Emails (occasionally)

This made it almost impossible to track concerns, check history, or ensure we addressed situations consistently.

---

## Investigation and Discovery

To figure out what the reporting system needed, I reviewed:

- What kinds of concerns had come up in the past  
- What information was usually missing when people shared something  
- What leaders needed in order to make a good decision  
- Where the breakdowns were in communication  
- What steps should happen immediately vs. what should be escalated  

The biggest finding was that we needed a **single, private entry point** where reports could be submitted and stored securely. We also needed a clear path for what leaders should do once a report came in.

## Solution: A Central Safety Reporting and Escalation Workflow

I designed a straightforward system that any member or leader can use. The new workflow includes:

### 1. A private safety reporting form  
Members can submit concerns confidentially. The form gathers the information leaders need without requiring the member to figure out what to include.

### 2. A central inbox  
Reports go to a single point of contact instead of scattered messages. This keeps everything organized and avoids situations where a leader misses something important.

### 3. A step-by-step escalation guide  
I created a simple framework for leaders:

- **Step 1:** Review the report and gather any missing details  
- **Step 2:** Decide whether it is an event-related issue or a personal matter unrelated to KMC  
- **Step 3:** Determine whether the issue needs follow-up, monitoring, or a more formal action  
- **Step 4:** Document the action taken  

### 4. Clear boundaries for KMC’s role  
Part of the process included defining what belongs in KMC’s scope and what doesn’t. For example:

- Event-related behavior = KMC responsibility  
- Personal issues between members outside events = outside KMC’s scope  

This clarity made it easier to respond consistently.

### 5. Documentation templates  
I created a reporting template for leaders to re-document any follow-up so we have a clear record of what happened.

## Implementation

Once the workflow was finished, I introduced it to coaches and captains. Each leader:

- Learned the reporting system  
- Understood what information to collect  
- Knew how to document actions and decisions  
- Knew when to escalate something to me or another leader  

The goal was not to create a heavy policy, but a simple, reliable way to handle sensitive situations.

---

## Results

The new system made a noticeable difference:

- Leaders felt more confident responding to concerns  
- Reports stopped getting lost in random channels  
- Members had a private, safe way to reach out  
- Actions taken on reports were consistent across different leaders  
- We could track issues over time and identify patterns if needed  

Most importantly, members felt supported knowing there was a structure behind the scenes.

---

## Documentation Created

The workflow included:

- Safety reporting form  
- Leader escalation guide  
- Follow-up documentation template  
- Clarified definitions of in-scope vs. out-of-scope issues  
- Messaging to members about how to privately report concerns  

---

## Lessons Learned

Handling safety concerns requires clear expectations and consistent communication. Even though these situations don’t happen often, having a documented process in place removes confusion and ensures every member is treated fairly and respectfully. This workflow continues to guide how leaders respond to sensitive situations while keeping the community safe and supported.
